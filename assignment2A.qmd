## Approach

This assignment is a task to connect PostgreSQL and R. My plan is to find a data set about movie-rating first, save it to PstgreSQL, and query the database directly from R.

There are other requirements about handling missing data and designing a database schema. I'll need to learn more about database schema.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
